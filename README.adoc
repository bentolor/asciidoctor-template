= Asciidoctor Template: A feature-rich example for beautiful HTML, PDF and RevealJS Presentation documents
Benjamin Schmid <@bentolor>

== Getting started

=== Installing prerequisites
Install _Ruby_, then install the Ruby Gems `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf`, `asciidoctor-revealjs`, `asciidoctor-diagram`, `asciidoctor-kroki` and `asciidoctor-chart`.

Check link:manual/workshop-installation.adoc[`manual/workshop-installation.adoc`] for detailed instructions.

=== Editor suggestions
I'd suggest https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] as you editor, as it offers several extension supporting Asciidoctor-based authoring. I recommend installing the extensions: 

* _AsciiDoc_ from _asciidoctor_
* _AsciiDoc Slides_ from _flobilosaurus_
* _vscode-pdf_ for inline PDF preview
* _Code Spell Checker_ and optionally additional dictionaries for spell-checking.
